A simple weather app that uses api keys with open weather.
Steps:
Go to OpenWeatherMap and sign up for an account.
Once logged in, navigate to the "API keys" section in your account settings.
Generate a new API key if you don't already have one.
Copy the generated key.
N/B wait for two hours for the keys to be active.
Happy coding ðŸ˜Š
